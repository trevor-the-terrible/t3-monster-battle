# Monster Battle

Spike to better understand more "complex" React interactions and
native state managment.

I used [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) to build.
  - Provides a well-defined Next/React starting point.
  - tRPC simplifies server/client side calls and let me focus on client-side code.

ShadCn
  - Provides well-defined components that are easy to customize per project.
  - Easy to override styles let me define a look ideal for the project

# Running project
> NOTE: I generally use `pnpm` for most internal projects as it installs
to a system-wide shared cache. With some exceptions testing `bun`
```sh
pnpm run ci;
pnpm run dev;
```

Via NPM

```sh
npm i;
npm run dev;
```
